Hello <%= @gift_membership.purchaser_name %>,

You have successfully purchased a One Year Gift Membership to the Chicago Tool Library. Go you!

Your gift code is: <%= @gift_membership.code.format %>

The recipient of this gift membership needs to use this code to complete the membership sign-up on our website or in-person at the Tool Library before their membership will be activated.

After completing their sign-up, they will need to bring the following into the library:

* Proof of their address
  This needs to include their name and current address in Chicago. Utility bills, leases, and other official mail work well.

* A photo ID
  This needs to show their name and a photo and can be from the state, their job, school, etc.

Once we review the above, they'll be ready to borrow for one year beginning on the date they come in.

Don't hesitate to email us at team@chicagotoollibrary.org with any questions!
